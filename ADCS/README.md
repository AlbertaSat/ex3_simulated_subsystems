# ADCS Simulated Subsystem

## Overview

The ADCS, also known as the Altitude Determination and Control System, is a
system that controls the orientation of ex3.

## Data types
- x,y,z angle
  - Representable as a triplet?
- x,y,z angular speed
  - Same representation as the x,y,z angle?
- ECI/ECEF/LLH position/velocity (Need definition)
- Coarse and fine sun vector (Need definition)
- Wheel speed
- Magnetic Field (IMU?)
- Comm status
- Rate sensor temperature (sensor measuring the wheel speed?)
